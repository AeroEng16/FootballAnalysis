1. Similar to this - https://github.com/JooZef315/football-tracking-data-from-TV-broadcast
       - Take pretrained Yolo5 and retrain on custom dataset
            - https://blog.roboflow.com/track-football-players/
                     - Don't bother with GK, ref etc. just get all people and then can split detected based on k-means
       - https://github.com/Mostafa-Nafie/Football-Object-Detection - example of using k-means clustering
      - Use the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric (Deep SORT) to improve object tracking

BALL DETECTION
- need a different model for the football itself
   https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/21/8693
- SAHI has drastically improved ball tracking, need to add possibly RNN wrapper to get better ball tracking

2. Compare to tracking data from skillcorner if I can find the broadcast feeds from these matches https://github.com/SkillCorner/opendata
      3518 Inter - Juventus - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEvflD64RnE
      3442 - Barca - Real - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlQe5-zb3dY&list=PLKj1QUtwqLN9FO6P8yIWMxACN3mnHDM6a&index=12

1. Paper below outlines reliable (~95%) algorithm to convert tracking data to event data
Automatic event detection in football using tracking data
Ferran Vidal‑Codina1  · Nicolas Evans2
 · Bahaeddine El Fakir2
 · Johsan Billingham2

Look at various metrics through here for examples to look at once the event + tracking data is available
