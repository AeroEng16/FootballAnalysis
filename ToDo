1. Similar to this - https://github.com/JooZef315/football-tracking-data-from-TV-broadcast
      - Pretrained Yolo V5 to highlight player and ball bounding box from broadcast feeds
      - Use the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric (Deep SORT) to improve object tracking
      - USe the resnet training to project TV sports field images onto 2D plane to get true tracking data - https://github.com/vcg-uvic/sportsfield_release?tab=readme-ov-file
            OR
      - Use the method from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neBZ6huolkg (likely not as robust)
2. Compare to tracking data from skillcorner if I can find the broadcast feeds from these matches https://github.com/SkillCorner/opendata
