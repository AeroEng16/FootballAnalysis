1. Similar to this - https://github.com/JooZef315/football-tracking-data-from-TV-broadcast
       - Take pretrained Yolo5 and retrain on custom dataset
            - https://blog.roboflow.com/track-football-players/
                     - Don't bother with GK, ref etc. just get all people and then can split detected based on k-means

BALL DETECTION
- need a different model for the football itself
   https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/21/8693
- Need to find way to improve ball detection
   - Try SAHI - https://learnopencv.com/slicing-aided-hyper-inference/
   - First step would be to take the test data on footballs and create code to split up and move labels with it. (SAHI library do this?)
   - Might need to improve image resolution after slicing 
       - could try this - https://arxiv.org/html/2402.00163v1#S5
                            - 

       - https://github.com/Mostafa-Nafie/Football-Object-Detection - example of using k-means clustering
      - Use the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric (Deep SORT) to improve object tracking
      - Use the resnet training to project TV sports field images onto 2D plane to get true tracking data - https://github.com/vcg-uvic/sportsfield_release?tab=readme-ov-file
            OR
      
2. Compare to tracking data from skillcorner if I can find the broadcast feeds from these matches https://github.com/SkillCorner/opendata
      3518 Inter - Juventus - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEvflD64RnE

1. Paper below outlines reliable (~95%) algorithm to convert tracking data to event data
Automatic event detection in football using tracking data
Ferran Vidal‑Codina1  · Nicolas Evans2
 · Bahaeddine El Fakir2
 · Johsan Billingham2

Look at various metrics through here for examples to look at once the event + tracking data is available
